# Loom

## Objective

The object of looms is to provide an asynchronous mock interview setting for associates to respond to 3 given prompts with 3 videos at a maximum of 5 min in length for each. Treat this like an interview, do not spend time preparing your answers.

## Requirements

1. Post 1 video (maximum of 5 minutes in length) per prompt.
    - Camera and Screen must be recorded with the prompt shown on the screen.
2. Once all 3 videos are submitted to the workspace, go back and watch your own videos, filling out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/2ty04ksdbs) as you go along.
3. Once the survey is completed, view 3 videos of your fellow co-workers . Please comment, ask a question or provide feedback at least once on each of those videos.
    - Ideally look to view another prompt for each of the 3 and maybe multiple co-workers.
